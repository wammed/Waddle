## How to Read This Public Record

- **Past AI outputs** are preserved as historical records to the extent necessary for provenance. They should not be interpreted as legal advice or as indicating that the project has obtained legal clearance.
- **Project actions** are recorded in terms of which design elements were removed, retained, or redesigned when similarity concerns were identified.
- **Current repository-facing records** are the individual `IP_COMPLIANCE.md` files placed in the Fluffy, Waddle, Rooney, and Toodle projects.

# AI Generation and Intellectual Property (IP) Audit History for the Four Applications Under Development

This document is an integrated chronological record covering the process from the initial conversations with Gemini, through icon similarity reviews and preparation of summary documents, to the final version (Due Diligence Record) following external review.

## 1. Common Design Policy and Audit Criteria

- **Unified design language:**
  - A **fully matte and flat design** that harmonizes with the COSMIC Desktop Environment (libcosmic) and Linux Wayland environments, eliminating gloss, neon glow, and fake 3D shadows (embossing).
  - GitHub README and store-listing asset banners use a **completely flat, solid charcoal-gray background**, with only the application icon and application name (AppName) minimally placed in the center.
- **IP compliance (provenance) management:**
  - To prevent rights-related issues specific to AI-generated assets and rejection during store reviews (such as Flathub and COSMIC Store) due to mistaken identity or confusion with third-party assets, `IP_COMPLIANCE.md`, documenting provenance (generation origin and review results), is deployed in each project's repository.

## 2. History, Similarity Findings, and Regeneration Evaluation for Each Application

### ① Fluffy (Video Wallpaper Manager for Linux / COSMIC DE)

#### 1. Initial Generation and Similarity Findings

- **Initial design:** A modern icon with a play symbol (▶) placed in the center of a flowing, cloud- or liquid-like design.
- **Similarity / risk findings by Gemini:**
  - **Fluid Video Player:** The composition of a play symbol (▶) placed within swirling liquid/water flow was evaluated as similar.
  - **Video Cloud:** The composition of a play symbol placed within the outline of a cloud was evaluated as similar.
  - **IRIS player:** The composition containing a play symbol within an amoeba-like organic shape was evaluated as similar.
  - **QNAP cloud surveillance:** A composition combining a cloud symbol and play button was cited as a comparison.
- These were AI-assisted visual comparison results and are not legal infringement determinations.

#### 2. Regeneration Process

1. **Change in direction:** To avoid possible confusion with generic video players, the project adopted an approach combining the application's initial “F” with elements associated with Linux/COSMIC DE.
2. **Adjustment of texture and composition:** Glow effects and glass reflections were removed, and the design was changed to a fully matte treatment with a charcoal-gray background. Background code snippets and unnecessary decoration were eliminated, transitioning to a minimalist banner containing only the icon and application name.
3. **Further revision due to concerns regarding official COSMIC design and obsolescence:**
   - An intermediate concept included “multiple orange rings in the lower-left,” which was pointed out as reminiscent of the orbital lines in the official System76 COSMIC DE logo.
   - A design concern was also identified that the central orange motif could resemble a generic atom symbol.
   - **Final revision policy:** The orange multiple rings, atom symbol, and gradients were removed. The initial “F” was reinterpreted as a video timeline or display frame using matte-white geometric lines, with a solid cyan-blue “display + play symbol” placed in the center.

#### 3. Evaluation of the Regenerated Icon

- **AI evaluation at the time:** The design was considered more differentiated from generic video/cloud icons.
- **Adobe Creative Cloud:** A broad resemblance was compared in relation to the flowing loop silhouette. The current composition has been redesigned as an F-shaped frame.
- **Papyrus:** Compared as an application in the same COSMIC video-wallpaper category. Whereas Papyrus uses a scroll/paper motif, Fluffy uses an F-shaped frame + display composition.
- **Official System76 logo:** The orange multiple rings were removed, resulting in a composition that does not depend on the official logo.

### ② Waddle (Fully Local AI-Integrated Next-Generation Linux Terminal Emulator)

#### 1. Initial Design and Similarity Findings

- **Initial design:** A Linux penguin (Tux) with its arms spread wide and a lightning bolt placed over a blue/green “W” background.
- **Similarity findings by Gemini:**
  - **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux):** The “W + Tux” composition was evaluated as strongly similar to WSL-related visual identity.
  - **WezTerm:** The terminal-emulator category and the initial “W” were cited as comparison points.
- These were AI-assisted visual comparison results and are not legal infringement determinations.

#### 2. Regeneration Process

- **Complete removal of the penguin:** Tux, identified as a factor in possible confusion with WSL, was removed.
- **Terminal-prompt integration concept:** Instead of a simple “W,” the silhouette of the “W” was reconstructed using geometric lines combining the Linux terminal input prompt (`>`) and code lines.
- **Integration and flattening of elements:** A minimalist lightning symbol representing local AI and high-speed processing was placed in the center, and the visual treatment was unified as fully matte with a solid charcoal-gray background.

#### 3. Evaluation of the Regenerated Icon

- **AI evaluation at the time:** The elements creating a visual association with WSL were considered to have been reduced.
- The current “W” has been redesigned as a geometric construction incorporating a terminal prompt, and Tux is no longer used.

### ③ Rooney (AI-Integrated Code & Markdown Editor for COSMIC / Wayland)

#### 1. Initial Design and Similarity Findings

- **Initial design:** A large gear in the background, a display containing a `</>` symbol in the center, and a bold “R” at the bottom.
- **Similarity findings by Gemini:**
  - **Official Rust language logo:** The “gear + R” composition was evaluated as strongly similar to the official Rust logo.
  - **RStudio / Posit:** Cited as a comparison based on the developer-tool category and the shared initial “R.”
  - **AI-generation traces:** The presence of a watermark or similar indication of AI generation in the initial image was also considered a quality issue.
- These were AI-assisted visual comparison results and are not legal infringement determinations.

#### 2. Regeneration Process

- **Complete removal of the gear motif:** The gear was removed to avoid a visual association with Rust.
- **Visualization of architecture:** The icon was redesigned as a geometric monogram based on Rooney's core feature, “two-pane editing (Split-View / Ctrl + \),” and its internal buffer structure, “Rope,” with the vertical stroke of the initial “R” represented as a two-pane layout.
- **Flattening:** The design uses matte lines on a solid charcoal-gray background.

#### 3. Evaluation of the Regenerated Icon

- **AI evaluation at the time:** The visual association with the official Rust logo was considered to have been reduced.
- The current monogram is based on application-specific concepts: R, Rope, and Split-View.

### ④ Toodle (Modern Digital Clock & Weather Widget for COSMIC Desktop Environment)

#### 1. Initial Design and Similarity Findings

- **Initial design:** A white monogram combining “T” and a clock dial on a charcoal background, with a glowing sun in the upper-right.
- **Similarity findings by Gemini:**
  - **Toodledo:** Cited as a comparison due to the shared beginning of the name and the similar task/time-management category.
  - **Todoist:** Compared based on the tendency of task-management icons to combine “T” with circular elements.
  - **Design issue:** The sun glow and outer-frame 3D embossing deviated from the project's common flat/matte policy.

#### 2. Regeneration Process

- The sun's glowing gradient was changed to a flat solid yellow.
- The three-dimensional shadow of the outer frame was removed.
- The design was simplified into a minimalist composition consisting of a solid charcoal background, “T” × clock dial, and a matte-yellow sun.

#### 3. Evaluation of the Regenerated Icon

- Unlike Waddle and Rooney, Toodle did not undergo a comparable structural redesign; the existing concept was retained while its texture and decoration were organized.
- The functional elements of **T**, clock, and weather were retained.
- This does not constitute a claim of legal clearance.

## 3. Revision Process Through External Review (Transition from Initial Draft to Final Version)

After the summary document was prepared, an external review was conducted from the perspective of legal and intellectual-property due diligence before deployment to open-source repositories such as GitHub.

### Clarification of AI-Specific Legal Overstatements

It was confirmed that expressions such as “Zero Risk,” “Approved,” and “Fully Compliant” in the initial draft were qualitative expressions generated by Gemini in conversation and did not constitute a comprehensive worldwide trademark search or a legal opinion by a patent attorney or lawyer.

Therefore, while these expressions are retained as historical materials, the policy was adopted that they would not be treated as legal conclusions in the project's formal repository records.

### Clarification of Scope & Limitations

Each `IP_COMPLIANCE.md` was organized as a due-diligence record intended to document the following:

- Design provenance
- History of similarity reviews
- Design changes made in response to similarity concerns
- Treatment of third-party assets and brand elements
- Limitations of AI-assisted review

These do not constitute comprehensive legal clearance.

### Standardization of Record Format

Waddle, whose full text had not been sufficiently presented in the conversation logs, was formally added, and the duplicate version of Fluffy was consolidated. A standardized `IP_COMPLIANCE.md` was prepared for all four applications, dated 2026-09-28.

## 4. Post-Change, Finalized Version: `IP_COMPLIANCE.md` Deployed to Each Repository

In the public-facing records organized for each repository based on the external review, definitive legal language generated by AI was not adopted; instead, the records were standardized around factual descriptions such as the following.

### Waddle

- The initial concept used W + Tux.
- Gemini's review identified visual similarity to WSL-related branding.
- Tux was removed, and the W was redesigned around a `>` prompt and code lines.
- AI evaluations and verification are not adopted as legal conclusions in `IP_COMPLIANCE.md`.

### Rooney

- The initial concept used gear + R.
- Gemini's review identified strong visual similarity to the official Rust logo.
- The gear was removed, and the icon was redesigned as a monogram based on R, Rope, and Split-View.
- The public document does not claim legal clearance.

### Toodle

- The basic concept of T + clock + weather was retained.
- Glow, gradients, and pseudo-3D effects were simplified.
- Weather icons derived from Meteocons continue to be managed as third-party assets separately from the application brand icon.
- No comprehensive legal clearance is claimed for the icon.

### Fluffy

- The initial concept used cloud/liquid + play symbol.
- The multiple-ring element in an intermediate concept that evoked official COSMIC branding was removed.
- The current concept is an F-shaped flowing frame + display/play symbol.
- The design was changed so that it does not depend on the official COSMIC logo.

## 5. Division of Roles Between Records

The icon-related records for the four applications are managed in the following two layers.

```text
ICON_DESIGN_HISTORY.md
ICON_DESIGN_HISTORY.ja.md
    ↓
Public design-change and provenance history spanning all four applications

IP_COMPLIANCE.md
    ↓
Current public-facing Due Diligence Record for each project
```

These documents serve different purposes. The intent is to distinguish between preserving historical AI evaluations and the legal position currently adopted by the project.

## 6. Finalized Version

### [Post-Change, Finalized Version] `IP_COMPLIANCE.md` Deployed to Each Repository

The following is the full text of the finalized version (prepared on 2026-09-28) that was reformulated based on the external review and deployed to the root of each repository. No summary or omission has been made; the original text is reproduced in full.

## ① Waddle Finalized Version (`IP_COMPLIANCE.md`) Markdown
# Icon Design & IP Compliance Due Diligence Record

This document records the provenance, design-review history, and IP due-diligence process for the **Waddle** application icon.

> **Scope:** This is a project provenance and due-diligence record. It is not a legal opinion, trademark clearance, or guarantee that no third-party rights are implicated.

## 1. Asset & Provenance

- **Application:** Waddle
- **Purpose:** Linux / COSMIC-oriented AI-integrated terminal emulator.
- **Generation method:** AI-assisted image generation and iterative refinement using Google Gemini.
- **Current design language:** Flat geometric matte styling with terminal/CLI elements.
- **Current visual concept:** A custom **W** constructed from terminal-prompt/code-like geometric segments, with a central lightning symbol.

## 2. Design Review History

### Initial concept

The initial Waddle icon combined a large W with a Linux Tux penguin and a lightning symbol.

The Gemini-assisted review identified a strong visual similarity between the W + Tux composition and WSL-related visual identity.

This was treated as a design-collision concern rather than as a definitive legal infringement finding.

### Revision

The project removed the penguin/Tux element and adopted a terminal-oriented design:

- the W is reconstructed from CLI prompt/code-like geometry;
- the `>` prompt concept is integrated into the letterform;
- the lightning symbol communicates AI/high-speed functionality;
- the visual treatment is matte and minimal.

This change deliberately moves the icon away from the earlier W + Tux composition.

## 3. Similarity Review

| Reference | Observation | Project action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| WSL / Windows Subsystem for Linux | Gemini identified a strong similarity in the earlier W + Tux composition. | Removed Tux and rebuilt the W using terminal-oriented geometry. |
| WezTerm | Same broad terminal-emulator category and W initial. | Current icon uses a distinct geometric W built from CLI prompt segments. |
| Alacritty / other terminal applications | Same general software category. | No known direct reuse of their branding was identified in the recorded review. |

## 4. Current Design Rationale

The current icon is based on the application's own name and function:

- **W** → Waddle;
- **`>` / terminal geometry** → terminal emulator;
- **lightning** → local AI / high-performance behavior.

The previous Tux mascot was intentionally removed as part of the design revision.

## 5. AI-Assisted Review Limitations

The Gemini conversation contains strong wording such as “zero risk,” “fully compatible,” and similar conclusions. Those statements are preserved as part of the historical source record but are not adopted here as legal conclusions.

The visual review was not a comprehensive trademark, copyright, design-right, or unfair-competition clearance.

No claim is made that no third-party mark anywhere in the world is similar to the current design.

## 6. Record Keeping

The detailed Gemini conversation is retained separately as the underlying development/provenance record.

This document is the concise public-facing record and should be updated if the icon changes materially.

## 7. Current Status

**Status:** The current icon uses the revised terminal-prompt W design without the earlier Tux element.

**Review date:** 2026-09-28


## ② Rooney Finalized Version (`IP_COMPLIANCE.md`) Markdown
# Icon Design & IP Compliance Due Diligence Record

This document records the provenance, design-review history, and IP due-diligence process for the **Rooney** application icon.

> **Scope:** This is a project provenance and due-diligence record. It is not a legal opinion, trademark clearance, or guarantee that no third-party rights are implicated.

## 1. Asset & Provenance

- **Application:** Rooney
- **Purpose:** COSMIC / Wayland-oriented AI-integrated Linux code and Markdown editor.
- **Generation method:** AI-assisted image generation and iterative refinement using Google Gemini.
- **Current design language:** Flat, non-glossy, matte styling on a solid charcoal background.
- **Current visual concept:** A geometric **R** incorporating the application's **Rope** concept and **Split-View / two-pane editing** concept.

## 2. Design Review History

### Initial concept

The earlier Rooney icon used a prominent gear combined with a large R and editor/code imagery.

The Gemini-assisted review identified a strong visual resemblance between the gear + R arrangement and the Rust programming language's official logo.

Because Rooney itself is implemented in Rust, the project considered it particularly important to avoid unnecessary visual association with Rust branding.

### Revision

The project replaced the gear-based composition with a geometric monogram based on:

- the letter **R**;
- the internal **Rope** buffer concept;
- **Split-View / two-pane editing**.

The revised icon uses a solid charcoal background and matte treatment.

## 3. Similarity Review

| Reference | Observation | Project action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Rust programming language branding | Earlier gear + R composition was identified as strongly similar. | Removed the gear motif and redesigned the symbol from application-specific concepts. |
| RStudio / Posit | Shares the broad R + developer-tool category. | Current design uses a different geometric construction and application-specific Split-View/Rope concept. |

## 4. Current Design Rationale

The final monogram is intended to represent the application itself rather than its implementation language:

- **R** → Rooney;
- **Rope** → editor buffer/data structure concept;
- **Split-View** → a core editor feature.

The gear motif associated with the earlier draft was removed.

## 5. AI-Assisted Review Limitations

The original Gemini conversation contains definitive phrases such as “zero risk,” “complete compliance,” and “approved.” Those phrases are historical AI output and are not adopted here as legal findings.

The recorded comparison does not constitute comprehensive trademark or copyright clearance.

In particular, the use of Rust as a development language does not by itself determine whether an icon is legally permissible; the relevant question is the actual visual asset and surrounding use.

## 6. Record Keeping

The detailed Gemini conversation is retained separately as the underlying development/provenance record.

This document is the concise repository-facing summary.

## 7. Current Status

**Status:** The current icon uses the redesigned geometric R / Rope / Split-View concept and does not intentionally reproduce the earlier gear-based composition.

**Review date:** 2026-09-28


## ③ Toodle Finalized Version (`IP_COMPLIANCE.md`) Markdown
# Icon Design & IP Compliance Due Diligence Record

This document records the provenance, design-review history, and IP due-diligence process for the **Toodle** application icon.

> **Scope:** This is a project provenance and due-diligence record. It is not a legal opinion, trademark clearance, or guarantee that no third-party rights are implicated.

## 1. Asset & Provenance

- **Application:** Toodle
- **Purpose:** Modern digital clock and weather widget for COSMIC Desktop.
- **Generation method:** AI-assisted image generation and iterative refinement using Google Gemini.
- **Current design language:** Flat, non-glossy, matte styling on a solid charcoal background.
- **Current visual concept:** The application initial **T**, an integrated **clock dial**, and a simplified sun/weather symbol.

## 2. Design Review History

The Toodle icon was reviewed for visual similarity and branding concerns.

Unlike Waddle and Rooney, the Toodle review did not result in a comparable structural redesign. The current concept remains based on the combination of:

- **T** → Toodle;
- **clock dial** → digital clock/time function;
- **sun/weather symbol** → weather function.

The Gemini record also discusses the use of Meteocons-inspired weather symbolism.

## 3. Similarity / Naming Considerations

The recorded review identified that clock + letter designs are a common visual approach and noted the potential for name/category similarity with time-management applications, including Toodledo.

This should be understood as a naming/marketplace observation, not as a conclusion that the Toodle name or icon infringes another party's rights.

No definitive legal clearance is asserted by this document.

## 4. Third-Party Asset Consideration

Toodle uses Meteocons-derived weather icon assets in the application separately from the application brand icon. Those assets should continue to be tracked under the project's third-party asset/license documentation.

The application icon itself is documented here as a separate branding asset.

## 5. Current Design Rationale

The icon communicates Toodle's functionality through a compact combination:

- **T** — application identity;
- **clock** — time;
- **sun/weather** — weather.

The design was intentionally simplified by removing excessive glow, lighting gradients, and skeuomorphic effects.

## 6. AI-Assisted Review Limitations

The Gemini source record contains statements describing the icon as “approved,” “original,” or otherwise legally safe. Those statements are historical AI output and are not adopted here as legal conclusions.

The review is not a comprehensive worldwide trademark, copyright, design-right, or unfair-competition search.

## 7. Record Keeping

The detailed Gemini conversation is retained separately as the underlying development/provenance record.

This document is the concise repository-facing summary and should be updated if the icon or its underlying third-party assets materially change.

## 8. Current Status

**Status:** Current T + clock + weather icon retained following the recorded visual review. No structural redesign was required as part of the recorded icon review.

**Review date:** 2026-09-28


## ④ Fluffy Finalized Version (`IP_COMPLIANCE.md`) Markdown
# Icon Design & IP Compliance Due Diligence Record

This document records the provenance, design-review history, and IP due-diligence process for the **Fluffy** application icon.

> **Scope:** This is a project provenance and due-diligence record. It is not a legal opinion, trademark clearance, or guarantee that no third-party rights are implicated.

## 1. Asset & Provenance

- **Application:** Fluffy
- **Purpose:** Video wallpaper manager for Linux / COSMIC DE
- **Generation method:** AI-assisted image generation and iterative refinement using Google Gemini.
- **Design direction:** Flat, non-glossy, matte visual language with a solid charcoal background.
- **Current concept:** A custom **F-shaped flowing frame** combined with a minimal **display + play** symbol.
- **Source record:** The detailed Gemini conversation log is retained separately as the development/provenance source record.

## 2. Design Review History

### Initial concept

The initial icon used a flowing cloud/liquid form with a central play symbol. The Gemini-assisted review identified visual similarities with the general design language of video/cloud applications, including examples such as Fluid Video Player, Videoクラウド, IRIS player, and QNAP cloud surveillance.

These observations are recorded as AI-assisted visual comparison results, not as legal determinations.

### COSMIC branding consideration

A later design incorporated a circular/multi-ring visual element intended to communicate the COSMIC environment. The review record described this element as resembling the official COSMIC branding.

Because use of an official third-party brand mark is a separate branding/trademark question from the originality of the surrounding artwork, the project decided not to rely on that element in the final icon.

### Current revision

The icon was revised to:

- remove the COSMIC-like circular/multi-ring element;
- remove unnecessary code snippets and decorative information;
- retain the Fluffy-specific **F** structure;
- retain the **display + play** functional symbol;
- use a simple, matte, solid-color presentation.

The purpose of this revision is to make the application identity independent of an official COSMIC logo or similar third-party brand element.

## 3. Third-Party / Similarity Review

| Reference | Observation | Project action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Video/cloud application icons | The initial cloud/liquid + play composition used common visual conventions in the video category. | Reworked the composition around a distinctive F-shaped frame and display symbol. |
| System76 COSMIC branding | A previous draft contained a visual element resembling the official COSMIC mark. | Removed that element from the current icon. |
| Papyrus | Same general COSMIC animated-wallpaper category. | Differentiation is based on the Fluffy-specific F/frame construction rather than reuse of Papyrus branding. |
| Adobe Creative Cloud | Gemini noted a broad flowing/loop-form resemblance in an earlier draft. | Current design is structured as an F-shaped frame rather than an Adobe-style loop. |

## 4. Current Design Rationale

The current icon intentionally communicates two things without relying on third-party branding:

1. **Fluffy** — represented by the custom flowing **F** frame.
2. **Video wallpaper** — represented by the display/play symbol.

The icon does not intentionally incorporate the official COSMIC logo.

## 5. AI-Assisted Review Limitations

The Gemini log contains AI-generated similarity assessments and recommendations. Those statements are retained as part of the provenance record, but they should not be treated as authoritative legal conclusions.

In particular, statements such as “zero risk,” “fully compliant,” “approved,” or “no infringement” in the original AI conversation are not adopted here as legal findings.

No claim is made here that the icon has undergone comprehensive worldwide trademark, copyright, design-right, or unfair-competition clearance.

## 6. Record Keeping

The detailed Gemini conversation should be retained as an underlying development record. This document is the concise public-facing summary.

The two records serve different purposes:

- `gemini-log.md`: detailed source/provenance record;
- `IP_COMPLIANCE.md`: concise, factual due-diligence summary suitable for repository publication.

## 7. Current Status

**Status:** Current icon revised to remove the COSMIC-like official-brand element.

The project should reassess the icon if its visual design changes materially or if new third-party similarity concerns are identified.

**Review date:** 2026-09-28

## 7. Update Policy

This document and the relevant `IP_COMPLIANCE.md` should be updated in the following cases:

- When the main structure or design of an icon is changed;
- When a new third-party asset is used;
- When new similarity or branding concerns are identified;
- When existing provenance information needs to be corrected or supplemented.

**Review date:** 2026-09-28
